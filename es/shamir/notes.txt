Consider the modification of the Shamir’s ( n,t)-threshold scheme where
calculations are over all integers and not over a finite field.  Show that this
modification is not perfectly secure, i.e.  knowledge of less than t shares
gives some information about the secret

There are four people in a room and exactly one of them is a spy.  The other
three people share a secret using the Shamir’s (3 , 2)-threshold scheme over Z
11. The foreign spy has randomly chosen his share.  The four pairs are P 1 =
(1, 7), P 2 = (3 , 0), P 3 = (5 , 10) and P 4 = (7 , 9).  Find out which pair
was created by the foreign spy.
