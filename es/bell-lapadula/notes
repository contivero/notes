( 15 points)  Given the security levels TOP SECRET, SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, and
UNCLASSIFIED (or- dered from highest to lowest), and the categories A, B, and C,
specify what type of access (read, write, or both) is allowed in each of the
following situations.  Assume that discretionary access controls allow anyone
access unless otherwise specified.  (a)  Paul, cleared for (TOP SECRET, { A, C
}), wants to access a document classified (SECRET, { B, C }).  (b)  Anna,
cleared for (CONFIDENTIAL, { C }), wants to access a document classified
(CONFIDENTIAL, { B }).  (c)  Jesse, cleared for (SECRET, { C }), wants to access
a document classified (CONFIDENTIAL, { C }).  (d)  Sammi, cleared for (TOP
SECRET, { A, C }), wants to access a document classified (CONFIDENTIAL, { A }).
(e)  Robin, who has no clearances (and so works at the UNCLASSIFIED level),
wants to access a document classified (CONFIDENTIAL, { B }).
