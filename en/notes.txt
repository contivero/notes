From Programming Pearls, p.14:
To shift an ordered collection i places to the left:

shift' i xs = reverse (reverse a ++ reverse b)
  where (a, b) = splitAt i xs


An example of a PSPACE-complete problem is the universality problem: does the
language described by a regular expression over the alphabet \(\Sigma\) equal
\(\Sigma^*\)?

In Turing Machines, 𝛿 is the "program" of the machine. A TM can "remember"
finite information in its state (see example 2.3 of Papadimitriou)
